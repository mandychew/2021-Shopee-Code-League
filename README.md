## Background
At Shopee, we strive to ensure our customers' highest satisfaction for their shopping and delivery experience - fast and accurate delivery of goods. This can be better achieved if we have key address elements for each user address which allows us to accurately geocode it to obtain geographic coordinates to ship the parcel to our customers. These key address elements include Point of Interest (POI) Names and Street Names. However, most addresses that Shopee receives are unstructured and in free text format, not following a certain pattern. Thus it is important for us to develop a model to precisely extract the key address elements from it.
